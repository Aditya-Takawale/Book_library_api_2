# Enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive Role-Based Access Control system implemented in the Book Library API, including enhanced data relationships, loan management, and security features.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed Features

#### 1. Enhanced User Model with RBAC
- **User Roles**: ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, MEMBER, GUEST
- **User Status**: ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING, DELETED
- **Security Features**: 
  - Failed login attempt tracking
  - Account suspension after 5 failed attempts
  - Last login timestamp tracking
  - Email verification status

#### 2. Enhanced Data Relationships
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: All models now have proper relationships with CASCADE operations
- **Audit Fields**: `created_by`, `updated_by` for tracking administrative changes
- **Popularity Tracking**: Books now track views, downloads, and popularity scores
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper database constraints ensure data consistency

#### 3. Loan Management System
- **BookLoan Model**: Complete loan lifecycle management
  - Loan status tracking (ACTIVE, RETURNED, OVERDUE, RENEWED)
  - Fine calculation for overdue books
  - Renewal system with limits
  - Due date management
- **BookReservation Model**: Queue-based reservation system
  - Priority-based reservation queue
  - Automatic expiration handling
  - Notification system for fulfilled reservations

#### 4. RBAC Dependencies and Middleware
- **Permission-Based Access Control**: Granular permission checking
- **Role-Based Dependencies**: FastAPI dependencies for different access levels
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access attempt logging
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access their own resources unless admin/librarian

#### 5. Enhanced API Endpoints

##### User Management (`/users/`)
- `GET /users/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /users/me` - Update current user profile
- `GET /users/` - List all users (admin only)

- `GET /loans/statistics` - Loan statistics (librarian/admin only)

##### Reservation Management (`/loans/reservations/`)
- `POST /loans/reservations` - Create reservation (member+ only)
- `DELETE /loans/reservations/{reservation_id}` - Cancel reservation
- `GET /loans/reservations/user/{user_id}` - Get user reservations
- `GET /loans/books/{book_id}/availability` - Get book availability
- `POST /loans/reservations/expire-old` - Expire old reservations (librarian/admin only)

#### 6. Enhanced Schemas
- **UserResponse**: Includes role, status, permissions, last_login
- **BookLoanResponse**: Complete loan information with business logic fields
- **BookReservationResponse**: Reservation details with queue position
- **LoanStatistics**: Statistics for administrative dashboard
- **BookAvailabilityInfo**: Real-time availability information

#### 7. Database Migration
- **Migration Created**: `enhance_models_with_rbac_and_relationships`
- **Applied Successfully**: All new tables and columns created
- **Backwards Compatible**: Downgrade path available

## Permission Matrix

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **ADMIN** | admin, manage_books, manage_authors, manage_users, admin_panel, create_review, vote_reviews, borrow_books |
| **LIBRARIAN** | librarian, manage_books, manage_authors, admin_panel, create_review, vote_reviews, borrow_books |
| **MEMBER** | create_review, vote_reviews, borrow_books |
| **GUEST** | (no permissions) |

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Endpoint-level permission checking
3. **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access their own resources
4. **Session Management**: Track and manage user sessions
5. **Failed Login Protection**: Account suspension after repeated failures

### Audit & Logging
1. **Access Logging**: All access attempts logged with user, resource, action
2. **Administrative Tracking**: Who created/updated records
3. **Security Events**: Failed logins, account suspensions logged
4. **Data Changes**: Audit trail for all data modifications

### Data Integrity
1. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Referential integrity maintained
2. **CASCADE Operations**: Proper cleanup when records deleted
3. **Business Rules**: Loan limits, reservation queues enforced
4. **Status Validation**: Proper state transitions enforced
